  "project1.description.line3": "Developed as a skill-focused exercise, this project emphasizes pragmatic engineering choices, code maintainability, and frontend/backend separation.",
  "project1.reactynote1": "To enable caching in the application filters, Redux-classic was introduced for state management in line with React applications.",
  "project1.reactynote2": "To reuse modal code, the HTML content was directly inserted into the tag, following a similar approach to React's $children property for populating content.",

  "project2.name": "TodoList - .NET backend implementation",
  "project2.description.short": "API layer for managing a minimal database with User and Task. Accessible via Swagger.",
  "project2.description.line1": "Minimal ASP.NET implementation of the APIs required for the TodoList project, with documentation and testing available via the Swagger page.",
  "project2.description.line2": "Scaffolding was built with EntityFramework based on a database designed for a previous project, including the User and Task entities and providing the necessary methods to perform CRUD operations.",
  "project2.description.line3": "The task search functionality allows searching by description using partial match, filtering by assigned user, and specifying an array of states (\"TODO\", \"IN PROGRESS\", \"DONE\") to display."
